				<p>Hi my name is Avery Wood I go to Bartlett High school and I am currently in 11th grade. I run Cross country and Track for the school. I love computers and I built one during this past summer. It was the fist build I have done by myself and it turned out really good. I am currently learning how to make a website, and I hope to make it the best one in my class. I would like to go into the field of grahpic design and IT when I get older and go to college.</p>
